\arguments{
\item{exchanges}{Vector of exchange names.}

\item{metrics}{Vector of metrics to request. Information on all available metrics can be found on page https://docs.coinmetrics.io/info/pair_metrics.}

\item{frequency}{Frequency of the pair metrics. Supported values are \verb{1h} and \verb{1d}.}

\item{start_time}{Start time of the timeseries. Multiple formats of ISO 8601 are supported.}

\item{end_time}{End time of the timeseries. Multiple formats of ISO 8601 are supported.}

\item{start_inclusive}{Flag to define if start timestamp must be included in the timeseries if present. True by default.}

\item{end_inclusive}{Flag to define if end timestamp must be included in the timeseries if present. True by default.}

\item{timezone}{Timezone for \code{start_time} and \code{end_time} timestamps. Default is UTC. Example: America/New_York.}

\item{page_size}{Number of items per single page of results. Default is 100.}

\item{paging_from}{Where first page starts: start or end of interval.}

\item{sort}{How results will be sorted. Metrics are sorted by \verb{(pair, time)} by default.
If you want to sort \verb{1d} metrics by \verb{(time, pair)}, choose \code{sort = "time"}.}

\item{limit_per_exchange}{Number of entries per institution.}
}
\value{
